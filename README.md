# Sign-Language-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Sign language 
The aim of this study is to use 
machine learning to overcome these communication barriers. Most of the 
existing technologies depend on external sensors, which are inaccessible 
for most people. We use OpenCV to take images and the CNN technique 
to train the machine, with the output being text. Many previous studies 
have provided methods for partial sign language recognition, but this study 
aims for the full recognition of American Sign Language, which consists 
of 26 letters. Most of the ASL letters are static, but some are dynamic. 
Therefore, the objective of this research is to extract features from finger 
and hand movements to differentiate between static and dynamicÂ gestures.
